# Bookstack Module
BookStack is a free and open-source platform for organizing and storing information, often described as a self-hosted wiki or documentation system. It's designed to be simple, easy to use, and suitable for both personal and team use. BookStack uses the concept of "books" to organize content into shelves, chapters, and pages.

## Getting Started
Setting the following...
```
megacorp.services.bookstack = {
  enable = true;
  app-key-file = "/run/secrets/bookstack-keyfile";
}
```
Will:
- Install Bookstack
- install MySQL (MariaDB)
- Install Nginx
- Open port TCP/80
- Configure Bookstack to connect to the MySQL instance
- Configure Nginx to serve Bookstack over http://localhost 

A secrets management solution should be implemented to securely pass the required Bookstack app key file. This can be generated by `head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64`. Setting up a secrets management solution is out of scope for this document.

## Default Credenials

## Additional Notes

### Use of overlay
This module uses the 24.11 bookstack package instead of the 25.05 due to a bug present in the 25.05 package that prevents the Bookstack application from compiling.
