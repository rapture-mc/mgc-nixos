# Bookstack Module
This module installs bookstack and all it's components.

## Simple Setup
Setting the following...
```
megacorp.services.bookstack = {
  enable = true;
  app-key-file = "/run/secrets/bookstack-keyfile";
}
```
Will:
- Install Bookstack
- install MySQL (MariaDB)
- Install Nginx
- Open port TCP/80
- Configure Bookstack to connect to the MySQL instance
- Configure Nginx to serve Bookstack over http://localhost 

A secrets management solution should be implemented to securely pass the required Bookstack app key file. This can be generated by `head -c 32 /dev/urandom | base64`. Setting up a secrets management solution is out of scope for this document.

Since `megacorp.services.bookstack.fqdn` still has the default value "localhost" Nginx will improperly handle any requests (for example requests made to the bookstack servers IP). It will however be available via http://localhost on the bookstack server itself.

To make it accessible over the network over it's IP for example...
```
megacorp.services.bookstack = {
  enable = true;
  app-key-file = "/run/secrets/bookstack-keyfile";
  fqdn = "192.168.1.10";
}
```
Or via a domain name...
```
megacorp.services.bookstack = {
  enable = true;
  app-key-file = "/run/secrets/bookstack-keyfile";
  fqdn = "bookstack.local";
}
```
